# you want to change this behaviour, use this option.
# 
# The current available options are (you can put more than one, separated with spaces)
#  MENU - the operation can be accessed from the main menu
#  POPUP - the operation can be accessed from the popup menu showed in the trees
#  DIALOG - the operation can be accessed from dialogs 
#  TOOLBAR - the operation can be accessed from the toolbar
#  NONE - the operation is hidden in the GUI
# your_operation_uid.visibility= POPUP DIALOG MENU TOOLBAR


#Menu position overriding
#All plugins can choose an arbitrary position of their operations in menus. If you want to choose them
#you can override this default position
#example:
#menu.file=1
#menu.file.export=2
